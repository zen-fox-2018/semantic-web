                Fashion is a highly visual industry, which explains why Instagram is the social network of choice for lovers of style. But there is far more fashion content online than what people share on social media. It has always been a strong niche for blogging.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are many quality fashion blogs, which unsurprisingly feature high-quality photographs of the latest fashion innovations.  Most fashion blogs are full of inspiration for those mornings you open your wardrobe door with your mind in a blank. They make an ideal place to begin your online research into what’s hot this year before you head off to purchase your own outfits. They can also provide you with ideas about what you can mix and match to create that perfect look.
            </p>
            <p>
                The successful online fashion bloggers are as much influencers as the big names who post fashion images on Instagram. Indeed, most of these fashion bloggers have an active Instagram presence as well.

                        Style Me Grasie is another blog that, although fashion focused, has widened its topics to include other subjects loved by its typical fan – posts on issues such as beauty, travel, and home inspiration interspersed with fashion features.

                    <p>
                        This blog is the online home of actress and writer, Grasie Mercedes, currently based in Los Angeles. She is Dominican by birth. She actually has four names, but she is best known by her grade school nickname, Grasie.                   
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As with most of these blogs, her posts feature luscious photography, focussing on people wearing the latest “in” fashion.                
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        A significant section of the blog is “Outfits,” and this predominantly features what Grasie wears in her daily activities. The posts are highly visual, with captions describing the outfits worn, often explaining why Grasie likes and wears particular items. She generally includes links to sites where her fans can buy items to emulate her look, often giving alternatives in various price ranges.
